          <p> As soon as you click one of the “Offer Game” buttons you’ll be taken to a game board that shows you as whichever color you chose.</p>
          <h3> What will happen next?</h3>
          <p>1. The new game you have created will be added to the list of games on the welcome page that other players can join.</p>
          <p>2. As soon as someone clicks “Join” to join your game, that person’s username will appear on your game board playing the other color and the board will indicate “White’s Move.”</p>
          <p>3. As soon as White makes the first move the board will change again to indicate “Black’s Move.”</p>
          <p>You can check your Dashboard any time to see the status of the games you are currently playing and the outcomes of the games you have played. Enjoy your games!</p>
