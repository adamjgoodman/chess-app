        1. <b> Offer a game or accept someone’s invitation  to play.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        2. <b> A game board opens.</b> As soon as two people have agreed to play, the game board will show both people’s usernames, who is online, and whose move it is. You need to be online to make a move, but you don’t have to be online at the same time.  
        </p>
        <p>
        3. <b>The board will redraw after each move</b> and keep track of pieces captured, moves that have been made, and whose move it is.

        <p><b>Your dashboard:</b></p>
        <p> 1.  You can play more than one game at a time. </p>
        <p>  2.  If you are only playing one game, when you log in you will go immediately to that game board.   </p>
        <p> 3.  If you’re playing more than one game, when you log in you will go to your dashboard. Your dashboard shows all the games you are currently playing, as well as listing all the games you have played. From there you can choose which game board you want to see.</p>

        <p><b>What does it cost?</b></p>

          <h3>Order of Events</h3>
          <p>1. The game you create will be added to the list of games others can join and you will be taken to your new game board.</p>
          <p>2. Once someone joins your game, their username will appear on your game board as the opposing color.</p>
          <p>3. White moves first. Until that happens, the board will indicate "White's Move". Once white moves, the board will change to indicate “Black’s Move.”</p>
          <p>You can check your Dashboard any time to see the status of the games you are currently playing and the outcomes of past games. Enjoy!</p>
